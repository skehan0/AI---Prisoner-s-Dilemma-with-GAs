In the first part where you are asked to evolve strategies against a fixed set of strategies
(or sets of strategies).

If you consider representing your strategies as a genotype of length 3
(what to do on first move, what to do following an opponent's cooperation, what to do following an opponent's defection),
we have a strategy space of size 8 (2^3). Any reasonably sized population is likely to find the fittest strategy in
the 1st generation hence negating the need for evolution.

Means to expand the space to show the evolution:

i) Rather than a choosing a binary alphabet, we could have real values indicating the probabilities of cooperating.
Mutation and crossover would have to be modified.

ii) Rather than considering a memory of length one, you could increase the memory length - for example, is a memory of 2 was used,
we would have a genotype of length 5 ( and hence a strategy space of 2^5). This would be what to do on the
first move, what to do following CC, CD, DC, DD by the opponent. This can be generalised. One could also
include one's own moves too in the memory condition
